# Testing and Debugging MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, along with debugging techniques.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up testing environments for both client and server
2. Write unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Apply debugging techniques for common MERN stack issues
